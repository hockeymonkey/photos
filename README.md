# This Photos app takes a random selection of photos from a node.js server and copies them to a local directory. If the user sets their desktop picture setting to the downloaded directory, then the user can have a picture slideshow sourced from their full picture library (which exists on the server machine) without having to have all the pictures taking up disk space on their local machine.
